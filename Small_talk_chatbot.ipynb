        "sequence-to-sequence models. The original tutorial is based off Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus, which is widely used for chatbot training purposes. But I personally feel that the results obtained with this dataset are suboptimal - afterall we cannot expect our simple model to learn how to generate coherent movie scripts. The dialogues from movies include artistic expression and a lot of uncertainity, which is where machines still struggle as of 2020. So, we can start with a simpler goal - make our chatbot do small talk about the weather and food. \n",
